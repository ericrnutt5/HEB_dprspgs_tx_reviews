Go check out he HEB in Buda or Kyle or BeeCave for that matter..makes this store look like red-headed step child.  I would rather travel 30mi one way than shop here and often do.

While the management may simply not be prepared to regulate the shoppers, they could regulate their own practices during this horrific time. None of the checkers had masks or gloves. Social distancing was unheard of. No sanitizer that was readily available for customers' hands. It was a cesspool of defiance regarding safe practices. Thank goodness it's only a 30-minute drive into Austin. Just called Sprouts and verified that all checkers and shelf stockers are wearing the basics of masks and gloves. Oh, yes, they are. Distancing is strictly enforced. Funny what 20 miles can do. I'll be happy to keep Austin weird.</td>\n",

And, what is on their shelves is up front where shoppers can reach and get to items. Many times I've had to get on my knees to reach items on the lower shelf that are way in the back. As many times I've had to reach up on the very top shelf, where extra items are, because the item's shelf is empty. Just today, I helped a customer who couldn't reach that top shelf.

One a-hole guy, when I came up to him and patiently waited for him to move his trash so I could get through looked up at me and shook his head with disgust that he had to clear the isle.  To me that is rude and he really doesn't realize that myself and other shoppers (in the grand scheme of things) pays his salary!  Where would he be without the customers??\\nHEB management maybe should hold a training session for these people and let them know that they should show courtesy to the customers as much as the checkers and other staff do..

It’s embarrassing, or should be for HEB HQ. I know for a fact this store grosses more than $1M per week and we have this crummy little store. Product availability is scarce and always in need of stocking. Go check out he HEB in Buda or Kyle or BeeCave for that matter..makes this store look like red-headed step child.  I would rather travel 30mi one way than shop here and often do. Hope this review gets corporate off their comfortable bun$ and expand this store and give us the store we deserve!   \n",

The florist here has not been very pleasant to deal with, she doesn't return phone calls or emails. She says one thing and it's another. I have sent Veronica at least 10 emails and she's still not got things together. My daughter's wedding date is October 20th and I still don't have flowers. Weddings are so stressful, especially when you are working with someone who says one thing and does another. Now I'm stuck with no Fresh Flowers for our only daughter's wedding. I will never return to this store again. I  was just informed that she wants a 320 dollar Delivery fee fo a Venue that's only 15 miles away. Needless to say I still don't have a florist  for my daughter's wedding.   \n",

The store was overrun with shoppers, no masks, all their kids running wild up and down the crowded aisles. While the management may simply not be prepared to regulate the shoppers, they could regulate their own practices during this horrific time. None of the checkers had masks or gloves. Social distancing was unheard of. No sanitizer that was readily available for customers' hands. It was a cesspool of defiance regarding safe practices. Thank goodness it's only a 30-minute drive into Austin. Just called Sprouts and verified that all checkers and shelf stockers are wearing the basics of masks and gloves. Oh, yes, they are. Distancing is strictly enforced. Funny what 20 miles can do. I'll be happy to keep Austin weird.   \n",

The Girl in Customer Service was so RUDE!!!!! She treated my husband as if he done it and also refused to trade it OUT!!!! SO Check your Tea.... When we went to the 2nd one we bought it was the SAME 🤦‍♀️😳   \n",

I purchased beer from this HEB that had gone bad on the shelf I got bad food poisoning from it as well and while I do like most of the employees I'm afraid one or two of the cashiers on occasion where rude. Now I don't know if they work there anymore but at the time I had one older woman who made rude comments to me and another who chatted up a storm with the person in front of me while they moved their 40 item cart through the  15 limit item checkout with a few carts behind as well.   \n",

I know that due to the pandemic, stores are not well stocked for reasons beyond their control, but I've been to other HEBs in the area and I find they are far better stocked. And, what is on their shelves is up front where shoppers can reach and get to items. Many times I've had to get on my knees to reach items on the lower shelf that are way in the back. As many times I've had to reach up on the very top shelf, where extra items are, because the item's shelf is empty. Just today, I helped a customer who couldn't reach that top shelf. Frustrated, and shopping in Wimberley or Austin where I can find and access everything I need, even if further away.   \n",

       "2021-11-21  1st keep in mind I love the Dripping Springs HEB store, very nice people friendly and helpful to customers but as they say there is always one bad apple in the bunch.\\nThe store had opened at 6am but it was already 7:30 when I was there and the overnight stock staff were still working and the isles were cram packed with cases of product and lots of empty boxes (trash) making it difficult to navigate almost every isle in the store.  One a-hole guy, when I came up to him and patiently waited for him to move his trash so I could get through looked up at me and shook his head with disgust that he had to clear the isle.  To me that is rude and he really doesn't realize that myself and other shoppers (in the grand scheme of things) pays his salary!  Where would he be without the customers??\\nHEB management maybe should hold a training session for these people and let them know that they should show courtesy to the customers as much as the checkers and other staff do..  Just a hint.\\nTo all the others (not the a-hole guy) you do a fantastic job and you were all champions during the pandemic by coming to work each day and serving us.  Thank you so much   \n",

I have always been treated very well here with the exception of a certain cashier named Diana.   I have had the extreme displeasure of having Diana as my cashier three times.   Each time she has been nothing but extremely rude , curt , and disrespectful to me and my family.    I have never been treated so poorly at any HEB.   Each time this has happened, I have respectfully communicated the issues with HEB management , they seem baffled and claim they have will end the problem.   Seems like management has no problem with Diana and her style of being rude to people.    Diana should flip burgers instead of working with customers.  I will take my business elsewhere.   I can afford it.   \n",

I asked her can I have that (to show her manager) and she THREW it at me. Management needs to get after the younger cashiers and baggers (this coming from a 22 year old with manners) - oh yeah, and expect side eyes, being on their phone while at cashier, and overstuffing the bags. Awful customer service.   \n",

Managers just sit around, lines, super slow, as busy as this HEB is, you think they would be fully staffed. This HEB really needs help. Poorly managed store. Called the store and the girl at the CS desk suggested I come early in the AM, when the typical American is working. Really helpful. Thanks.\\n\\nEDIT: wow this HEB is really really bad.   \n",

Cashier's are friendly. Pickers are a little rude sometimes. But it is always packed with the rudest, try to run over people. Even the parking lot. It is not a pleasant experience. Been going to Wimberly more it's a whole different experience.   \n",
